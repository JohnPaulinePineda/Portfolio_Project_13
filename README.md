This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_13/) explores the various remedial procedures for handling imbalanced data for classification. Using a Bagged Trees model structure, methods applied in the analysis to address imbalanced data included the Random Undersampling, Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Random Oversampling Examples (ROSE). All procedures were implemented both within and independent to the model internal validation process. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying various remedial procedures were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) metric. The AUROC values were compared to that of the baseline model without any form of data imbalance treatment.
